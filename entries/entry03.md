### Previous
I talk about how `loadSprite("bean", "images/bean.png")` and `kaboom()` works and a `bean` is a sprite. a sprite is like a character that moves around the computer screen and the character you are controlling.
### Content
I learn how to make my Sprite apper in my screen becuase you can't get image from kaboom just by downloading a code you have to go to github webpage of kaboom to download their files of sprite image. Then I put my html file inside of the kaboom file and now I get everything kaboom.
[Kaboom Github](https://github.com/replit/kaboom)
So I made my Sprite apper on screen and didn't apper before because I didn't connect it to the kaboom files and it took me a while to figue out the problem to slove it. Now my Sprite is in the position of 80, 40. By using `pos(80, 40)` it will made my Sprite apper in the screen of x 80 and y 40. The problem is I don't have a floor or a ground to help it not keep following because mine keep falling everytime I restart.
