Mvp is call Minimum Viable Product, and is very important for adding the main things before adding things that makes my game looks better and the quality.
`Mvp plan` Planing idea for my game and add more detail in the future after finishing adding the main details to my game


### Context
I have to move all my code to replit because the game won't apper. Moving to replit is a good things because it gives me everything I need to complete my game.

*You can make your own design
*Have beginning code
*Tools
*Webview

while adding mvp to my mvp plan I add: a way to how the level and the design to my game looks like.

```JS
map = [
  "                               ",
  "                               ",
  "                               ",
  "           ^         ^         ",
  "                  ===          ",
  "        ===                     ",
  "           ^           ^       ",
  "                               ",
  "========   =======   ==========",

  = - is the blocks

  ^ - is the enemys


    Inside the `"   ",` is the object and the gameplay.

  "                               ",
  "                               ",
  "                               ",
  "                               ",
  "                               ",
  "                               ",
  "                               ",
  "                               ",
  "                               ",
]
```

My partner Selina also add something to make the sprite move.

```JS
        onKeyDown("right", () => {
        mc.move(-SPEED, 0)
        })

        onKeyDown("left", () => {
        mc.move(SPEED, 0)
        })

        onKeyDown("down", () => {
        mc.move(0, -SPEED)
        })

        onKeyDown("up", () => {
        mc.move(0, SPEED)
        })

        I redesign a little bit on the code
        I make it reverse control so when you press the left key it move to the right and if You press the right key it moves to the left keys.
```
      Engineering Design Process: `Improve as needed`
      Skills: `Organization` manage my code very clearly and have put comments to know what the code does.
