Mvp is call Minimum Viable Product, and is very important for adding the main things before adding things that makes my game looks better and the quality.
`Mvp plan` Planing idea for my game and add more detail in the future after finishing adding the main details to my game


### Context
I have to move all my code to replit because the game won't apper. Moving to replit is a good things because it gives me everything I need to complete my game.

*You can make your own design
*Have beginning code
*Tools
*Webview

while adding mvp to my mvp plan I add: a way to how the level and the design to my game looks like.

```JS
map = [
  "                               ",
  "                               ",
  "                               ",
  "           ^         ^         ",
  "                  ===          ",
  "        ===                     ",
  "           ^           ^       ",
  "                               ",
  "========   =======   ==========",

  = - is the blocks

  ^ - is the enemys


    Inside the `"   ",` is the object and the gameplay.

  "                               ",
  "                               ",
  "                               ",
  "                               ",
  "                               ",
  "                               ",
  "                               ",
  "                               ",
  "                               ",
]
```
