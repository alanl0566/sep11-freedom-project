#### Context
For the Freedom project tool I have been thinking which tool I should pick but there's a lot I want to try but I can only pick one and the only one I can stick with are a game engine. `Kaboom`, I first picked `Three.js` because you can make animation web page but I don't know what I can make by using Three.js. So I want to use Melon.js a game engine but you have to download 2 or 3 software so I have to use another game engine and is it `Kaboom`. Why? Because you don't need to download any software and is the easiest game engine/programming library to make game becasue they have a thing call `playground` that has everything you need to make a game, like any game and they also have a tutorial. I feel like is pretty easy because all I need is to design or a png image of a main character for my game.

#### What I am going to make with it

Probably a 2d parkour game or a platformer game because I play a lot of parkour and I want to try it out myself. So how it work is you have to parkour to go to other stages and every level is getting harder and harder. Also maybe there will be a part where there will be something chasing you. I'm still not yet confirm what to put in the game yet.

`Plan the most promising solution` then start the `Mvp` and after that you can put things to make it better.

`How to learn` is a skill to define on your own like tinker a tool or finding the error.
